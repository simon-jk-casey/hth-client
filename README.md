CURRENT WORKING:
rendering history
need reducer case for toggling history for show more
~~these two are done but not tested, need data to test, see next requirement

SERVER:  NEED JOIN BETWEEN DATA TABLE AND DEVICE TABLE FOR HISTORY ROUTE


TO DO:

DATA ENTRY COMPONENT:
Refine/refactor predator selection (create array, map and render?)
change from radio input to divs with an "isSelected" condition in the state?

SUCCESS NOTIFIERS UPON ADDING INFO (SIGNUP/DEVICES/DATA)

REFACTOR:
destructure state references

ABILITY TO CHANGE USER INFO IN PROFILE

APPLY MENU TO OTHER COMPONENTS

HAVE ADD DEVICE COMPONENT RENDER INSIDE THE DEVICES COMPONENT RATHER THAN A SEPERATE ROUTE

RENDERED DEVICELIST
add ability to edit/delete

ALLOW BACK/FORWARD NAV IN SHEET ROUTER

BE AWARE OF AREAS WHERE STATE MAY NEED TO BE RESET
Watch addDevice, signup cancellation

ADD TOGGLE TO MENU COMPONENTS
color change when on selected route

SERVICES:
signup and addDevice - alter and test, works but looks wrong/some redundancy -- THIS MAYBE ok, but can specify them down to the responses from server
